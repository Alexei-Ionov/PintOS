Project Description
This project encompasses the development of various functionalities within an operating system, aimed at enhancing efficiency, isolation, and protection for user programs. Key highlights include:

Program Execution: Developed the functionality to execute user programs within the operating system environment, ensuring optimal performance, isolation, and security.

System Call Optimization: Streamlined process and file system call functionalities, integrating support for floating-point operations into the kernel. Emphasis was placed on efficient handling of thread initialization, scheduling, context switches, interrupts, and system-wide synchronization.

Memory Management: Engineered dynamic memory allocation capabilities, enabling user programs to request memory from the operating system via sbrk. Implemented malloc, realloc, and free functions within the kernel to facilitate efficient memory allocation and prevent fragmentation.

Filesystem Development: Implemented a filesystem inspired by Berkeley Fast File System (FFS), featuring a buffer cache, extensible files, and support for subdirectories.
