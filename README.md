• Developed the functionality to run user programs in an operating system, ensuring efficiency, isolation, and protection
• Streamlined process/file system call functionality and integrated floating-point operation support into the kernel, while also
focusing on handling thread initialization, scheduling, context switches, interrupts, and system-wide synchronization
• Engineered dynamic memory allocation, allowing user programs to request memory from the OS via sbrk, and implemented
malloc, realloc, and free on the backend in the kernel to run an efficient memory allocator that prevents fragmentation
• Implemented a filesystem akin to Berkeley FFS with a buffer cache
